# Electron XVFB

I am having some issues capturing a screenshot of a page in the VS Code Electron
process, so I'm trying to reproduce the problem on Electron standalone to see if
I can rule out VS Code as the cause.

I am using Electron 6.1.5 which is the version my broken VS Code (1.40.2) uses.

`npm start` and check the [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/main.yml).
